      <p>
        After arguing unsuccessfully with an online classifieds portal
        about the concept of commerciality, I would like to remind
        everyone that I do offer a repair service for Nokia N-Gage
        devices on a completely private basis.  Of course, this will
        continue to be absolutely free of charge and without any
        intention of making a profit. In other words, in the spirit of
        the Repair Caf√© initiative.

    <h2>Nokia N-Gage repair support</h2>

    <h3 id="the-problem">The Problem</h3>

    <p>
      Your N-Gage shows the Nokia logo at start-up and then goes off
      again? Or the operating system runs unstably and crashes
      constantly?
    </p>

    <p>
      In 99% of these cases the unit suffers from a utilised user space
      area (phone memory). The result is a so-called
      WSOD <label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"
      class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">White Screen of
      Death. Which admittedly sounds a bit harsh, but is understandable
      since you can't fix the problem without additional
      hardware.</span>
    </p>

    <h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>

    <h4 id="wsod-fix">WSODFix</h4>

    <p>
      If you'd like to take it into your own hands, check out my project
      WSODFix. It's a simple microcontroller circuit based on an
      STM32F103 blue pill board.
    </p>

    <p>
      The WSODFix tries to format the user memory via FBus. In most
      cases, this is sufficient.  Unfortunately, it is often not so easy
      to find a suitable cable with which to connect the
      N-Gage. Soldering on improvised cables is often undesirable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project is completely open source and can be found
      on <a href="https://github.com/mupfelofen-de/WSODFix">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="twister-fix">Using propritary hardware</h4>

    <p>
      Alternatively, the user memory can be formatted via proprietary
      hardware.  However, this is a good opportunity to upgrade the
      firmware to the latest version 4.60, at least for an N-Gage QD.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this version only exists with the branding of a
      Spanish service provider, but it offers the possibility of
      resetting the user memory itself with the help of a key
      combination when booting the device.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is the preferred method in most cases. However, there is
      unfortunately no German language setting in this firmware, but
      there is an English one.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are willing to pay the shipping and return costs, I will be
      happy to do so free of charge, as it is unfortunately not easy to
      find suitable and functioning service hardware.
