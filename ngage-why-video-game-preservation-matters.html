        This article is all about video game preservation, the value of
        things, the Nokia N-Gage and most and foremost why it is
        important to preserve it for posterity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why video game preservation matters</h2>

    <h3>A few words about myself</h3>

    <p>
      First of all, I would like to introduce myself: my name is Michael
      Fitzmayer, I'm a dad, husband, gearhead and software
      developer. About in this order.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not working on my projects or wrenching on old mopeds, I
      work as an embedded software developer in a company for mobile and
      industrial automation technology. Other than that, I have a great
      interest in hacker culture and feel part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But probably the most relevant aspect of myself that plays a role
      in this article: I love video games. I always have, for over 30
      years, and always will. This love has always included the Nokia
      N-Gage, ever since it came into my life, and even if it ultimately
      did not give Nokia the success the company deserved, it has always
      connected and continues to connect a group of enthusiasts who
      share this passion.
    </p>

    <h3>Connecting people</h3>

    <p>
      Last year, we started a small but steadily
      growing <a href="https://discord.gg/dbUzqJ26vs">online
      community</a> dedicated solely to the N-Gage era. Old hands meet
      there, but also interested people who have received an old device
      as a gift and would like to learn more about it. If these units
      are broken, we can often offer our help and knowledge or repair
      them, usually completely without the intention of making a
      profit. Because it's very dear to us that people can experience
      the N-Gage the way we do.
    </p>

    <h3>The rocky road ahead</h3>

    <p>
      But one of the most important goals of our work: to preserve this
      part of video game history for all future generations to
      come. This is where the N-Gage becomes particularly interesting,
      because in addition to the 55 games that were commercially
      available, there were at least half as many titles that never made
      it to a public release. You quickly feel like a digital
      archaeologist digging for old treasures in order to recreate the
      historical context of these possible finds.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is exciting but unfortunately also more difficult with every
      month that passes. There are many reasons for this:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Former developers are worried about damaging their reputation
        because they are still working in the video game industry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Among collectors, the narrative of the alleged loss of value
        through digital availability often prevails.
      <li>
        It is often legally complex; since video games are such a new
        medium, the copyright for them hasn't run out in most
        cases. Fortunately, some organisations, such as the Internet
        Archive, have a so
        called <a href="https://archive.org/about/dmca.php">DMCA
        exemption</a>.<label for="sn-1" class="sidenote-toggle
        sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"
        class="sidenote-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Exemptions are
        granted when it is shown that access-control technology has had
        a substantial adverse effect on the ability of people to make
        non-infringing uses of copyrighted works. The exemption rules
        are revised every three years.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Often these relics are simply forgotten because they never
        represented anything obviously special.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And the longer this search lasts, the smaller the chances of
      finding something new, and with every chance that is lost, there
      is one more title that remains lost forever.<br />  In addition,
      time is pressing. The lifespan, especially of the flash cells on
      the writeable memory cards, will soon have exceeded their
      guaranteed lifespan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately, there are organisations such as
      the <a href="https://archive.org/details/softwarelibrary">Internet
      Archive</a> or the <a href="https://gamehistory.org/">Video Game
      History Foundation</a> that have made it their business to
      counteract this development. The Internet Archive now has a
      gigantic and constantly growing collection of games that are now
      accessible to a broad and interested mass. Thousands of them can
      be played directly in the browser.
    </p>

    <h3>We need you more than ever</h3>

    <p>
      At this point, we would like to appeal to you, former Nokia
      employees or partners who experienced this era from a unique
      perspective, and ask you to support us in our efforts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do you perhaps still have an old document in a drawer that could
      be of interest? Or even an old memory card that has been forgotten
      over the years? Or even a copy of the N-Gage SDK that could secure
      the future development of this peculiar platform? Please let us
      know.
    </p>

    <p>
      We and hopefully future generations will thank you, and on behalf
      of the entire N-Gage Online community, thank you for your time and
      attention. — Michael, <a href="https://mupfdev.github.io">mupf.dev</a>

      “If there's any advice I have for people out there it's that if
      your project, whatever it is, ends up being cancelled please
      consider making a file folder with the name of your project,
      throwing everything you have in there and putting it away. We as
      audience, fans and historians have discovered that no matter how
      minor you may have felt your work was, no matter how sad you are
      that it never reached some sort of goal or completion, the
      applause, the appreciation, the debt of hunger for the knowledge
      of what you worked on will come. It will take years, it will take
      a very long time, but your file folder of memories, ideas and
      sketches will be as like gold when you bring it out into the world
      in years hence. And I aim this advice to people at any stage in
      their career, beginning middle and nadir.”
