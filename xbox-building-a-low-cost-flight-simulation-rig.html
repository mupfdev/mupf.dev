    <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

    <p>
      Ever since I bought my first PC, a Compaq 386, at a garage sale in
      the late 1990s, I have been fascinated by technology and the
      desire to understand it, never waned.  Looking over all these
      years, apart from my fascination with programming, there is one
      constant that kept me mesmerised in one way or another, and that
      is flight simulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Starting with Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0 to 5.0, which were
      already outdated at that time, to titles like Digital
      Integration's <a
      href="https://github.com/TornadoGame/Tornado">Tornado</a>, a
      technical masterpiece (!), and MicroProse's Falcon series, I have
      always somehow stuck to this genre.
    </p>

    <p>
      Years later I ended up with a full Saitek Cessna Pro Flight Rig
      and X-Plane 9.  The simulator never ran particularly well on my
      PC, but in the end I didn't care.<br>

      Eventually the hobby fell by the wayside again.  My own family
      plans came to the fore and finally, I had the glorious idea of
      selling all my equipment on eBay to buy a Switch Lite.  Yes, you
      heard that right.  I simply didn't have the time and the equipment
      ended up gathering dust and taking up space I didn't have.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking back, it was a very wise decision and I don't regret
      it. Sure, in the years that followed, I always felt like taking up
      the hobby again, but in the end it was very relieving to get rid
      of all the junk in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as one would expect, I recently felt the need to pick it
      up again.  But where do I start?  A powerful PC is expensive and
      so is flight simulation equipment.  Moreover, I would fall back
      into old patterns and bring more stuff into my life that I don't
      really want any more.  So that was definitely not an option.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a bit of research, I quickly realised my best option was
        to buy a second-hand Xbox Series S and Microsoft Flight
        Simulator.  The price was simply unbeatable!
    </p>

    <p>
      But how does flight simulation fare on the Xbox? Especially if you
      are seriously interested in the subject matter?  In various online
      communities I quickly came across the narrative that the Xbox is
      only a good entry point into the realm of flight simulation.  As a
      way to pick up the <i>casual gamer</i> and prepare them for more.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is, after all, a closed, proprietary system with limited
      hardware compatibility and fewer options for customisation.  So if
      you are serious about the hobby, the narrative goes, the only
      logical step you can take is to get a full-fledged gaming PC.  As
      already mentioned, I certainly don't want that!
    </p>

    <p>
      I mean, after all, it's the same software, just on a different
      platform, right?  How hard can it be?  That was the moment I
      decided to do what I do best: build it myself.  This series is all
      about showing you what can be done, how I upcycled defective
      hardware and get it to work with my Xbox Series S.
    </p>

    <h3 id="hardware">The Hardware</h3>

    <h4 id="communication">Communication</h4>

    <p>
      At the very beginning, the main question I asked myself was which
      options I had for communicating with the Xbox.  It was certainly
      not an option to convert an Xbox controller or adapt compatible
      flight simulation input devices to my preferences. This would be
      expensive, unnecessarily complicated and time-consuming.<br>

      However, it seemed possible to connect a keyboard and mouse.
      Perfect!
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, a keyboard was nothing more than a standardised input
      device, so it was reasonable to assume that HID<label for="sn-1"
      class="sidenote-toggle
      sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"
      class="sidenote-toggle"><span class="sidenote">The USB human
      interface device class (USB HID class) is a part of the USB
      specification for computer peripherals: it specifies a device
      class (a type of computer hardware) for human interface devices
      such as keyboards, mice, game controllers and alphanumeric display
      devices.</span> input devices would be detected by the Xbox.
    </p>

    <p>

      It was worth a shot! I briefly tried to programme a
      microcontroller so that it is recognised as an HID keyboard and
      continuously sends keystrokes to the host connected to it.  When
      everything worked on my laptop, I connected the device to my Xbox
      and lo and behold, it worked!
    </p>

    <p>
      In a nutshell, HID devices are ideal for this project and are
      infinitely flexible thanks to microcontrollers.  This even works
      if you connect a regular keyboard in parallel.  Time to get
      started!
    </p>

    <h4 id="autopilot">The Autopilot</h4>

    <p>
      One of the most important instruments in an aircraft is the
      autopilot. Sure it's fun to fly an aircraft by hand, but in a
      simulated environment you want to be able to navigate. Regardless
      of the weather and visibility. In addition, monitoring individual
      systems can become a complex task, especially if you don't have a
      co-pilot who can take care of it.  So the autopilot is very
      helpful and its use is also entirely realistic.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      For this reason, I converted a
      defective <a href="https://www.manson.com.hk/product/ssp-8160/">Manson
      SSP-8160</a> laboratory power supply.  I gutted most of it and
      fitted it with an STM32F103 Blue Pill microcontroller board.  I
      replaced the 7-segment displays
      with <a href="https://tasmota.github.io/docs/TM163x/">TM1637</a>-based
      equivalents, attached new rotary encoders and only reused the

      140 autopilot system</a> from Bendix/King, which is used in many
      aircraft.  Including my personal favourite, the <a

      Turbo-Porter</a>.

    <p class="free-standing">
      The boot-up phase and the behaviour of the firmware is modelled
      after the version used by the <a
      href="https://blackbirdsims.com/flight/PG.php?id=74">Pilatus
      Porter PC-6 by Blackbird Simulations</a>.  In addition, since
      there is no way to read data back from the simulator, there is
      also the option to change the state of the device without sending
      keystrokes to the Xbox. This is very useful when the simulator and
      the device are out of sync. This is rarely necessary, but it does
      happen.

      Thanks to a custom keyboard profile, the operation is surprisingly
      pleasant.  The entire autopilot, including vertical and lateral
      navigation, works flawlessly and the haptics provide perfect
      immersion.  It makes a huge difference whether operating the
      autopilot virtually, or configuring it manually, as if you were
      sitting right in the cockpit.  I have already successfully
      completed several flights using it, with hardly any difficulties
      worth mentioning.

      Overall, the whole project is very much tailored to my individual
      needs, and without customisation an exact replica would probably
      not make much sense, and overall it is quite
      undocumented. Nevertheless, it provides a fairly stable basis for
      designing your own hardware. For this reason I have uploaded the
      complete source code to
      GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mupfdev/HID-FCU">HID-FCU</a>

    <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

    <p>
      For flight simulator enthusiasts, the Xbox Series S is an
      unbeatable alternative to a PC for flight simulator
      enthusiasts. Sure, there is no possibility to fly on networks
      like <a href="https://vatsim.net/">VATSIM</a> as of today, but for
      all those who can live with this trade-off, I can highly recommend
      it.  In addition, it hardly takes up any space and can be expanded
      with your own peripherals relatively easily and inexpensively due
      to its compatibility with the HID standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am very happy with the results so far and I'm looking forward to
      adding more custom built hardware to the rig.  More than anything,
      though, I hope that in this way I have been able to create more
      interest in cockpit building among Xbox users.  Happy hacking!
